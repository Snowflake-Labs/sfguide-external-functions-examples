In the following example, we demonstrate how to use external functions to invoke an API via Azure API Management that will trigger an Azure function. The Azure function is written in Python and invokes the Microsoft Translator API provided by Azure Cognitive services to return the Italian translation for a given input text string. This solution with external functions eliminates the need to manually export the data out of Snowflake, translate it, and then reimport it, greatly simplifying the workflow. You can find more deatils on the solution in the following blog post:
